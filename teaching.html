      <p> I began teaching music in the Pennsylvania public schools fresh out of college in August 2002.  Since then I have taught all grades
        from Kindergarten to Grade 7 general music, chorus, and beginning band.  <b>General Music</b> has been my
        favorite subject area as it allows for the most diverse instruction and topics, especially with the opportunity for
        applied keyboard study and the implementation of digital learning.  Here are some favorites from my general music classroom in recent
        years. </p>

        <h2> Interactive Pages & Easter Eggs </h2>
        <p> One of my favorite additions to digital learning has been utilizing interactive pages
          to better engage my students.  My favorite method is to incorporate hidden "Easter Eggs" with fun
          and relavant links. </p>

        <h2>Video Game Music Unit </h2>
        <p> One of my favorite units that I have created (and one of the biggest hits in my classroom) has been
          the <b>Video Game Music Unit</b>.  In this unit, we discuss a brief history of computer-generated sound,
          compare and contrast video game music and movie music, and discuss thematics/ theme & variation.  My students
          are then set free to create their own ideas for a video game, creating a plot/ story, graphics, and digital
          music. In my general music classroom, we do everything BUT code the game, although students are most welcome to
          try if they have the time in their process.  It's amazing to see the diverse and creative ideas that my students create
          in these projects.  Look out, world!  There will be many new game-developers and sound designers coming your
          way in the next decade! </p>

            <h2>Yoga Teaching </h2>
            <p> In 2013, I began the free yoga class that met at <em>Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh: Brookline</em>,
              my local branch.  This was a wonderful way for me to engage with my neighborhood and allow a space for
              people to practice self-care.  Although I "retired" in 2020, I am so proud of this yoga community we
              were able to create! </p>
