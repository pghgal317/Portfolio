        <h2>Some Recent Work </h2>
        <p>I am proud of my learning process thus far, so, in addition to this webpage itself, here are some snippets of recent programming
          assignments, projects, and exploration. The <b>first images</b> are a project from Object-Oriented Programming using Java.  It was an
          experiement with creating a Graphic User Interface and interactive buttons.  The <b>second images</b> are from a group
          project for TechWise using Python and PyGame and was an experiment in creating
          game menu graphics.  The <b>third images</b> include two different simple programs from Java Programming
          and Object-Oriented Programming using Java. </p>

        <h2>About Me </h2>
        <p><b>Amy Ciuffoletti </b> is someone who is excited to learn and try new things. When Covid hit and remote teaching and
          learning became the new normal, she was ready!  Already utilizing digital instruction in her classroom, she took it upon
          herself to help her colleagues adopt tools and resources to aid in remote instruction.  This lead to Amy taking on greater leadership
          in educational technology by assisting her school in learning the Schoology Learning Management System when it was implemented in the fall of 2020.
          When blended learning was implemented, Amy found it to be an inspiring challenge that resulted in engaging digital lessons which still continue in a normal
          educational setting.  Amy's interest in digital learning and software only increased, resulting in pursuing an additional degree in
          Software Development beginning in Fall of 2021, which lead to her participation in the TechWise pilot program in March of 2022.
          As her studies progress, Amy continues to fall more and more in love with this new path, especially creating interactive programs
          and creative problem-solving. In addition to learning, Amy loves the outdoors, travel, music, and comedy.  She currently lives in
          Pittsburgh, PA with her husband Doug and amazing step-daughter Lillian. </p>
